# zakura-sapling-crypto

`zakura-sapling-crypto` is the [Zakura](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura)
fork of the upstream
[`sapling-crypto`](https://crates.io/crates/sapling-crypto) crate from
[zcash/sapling-crypto](https://github.com/zcash/sapling-crypto), maintained in
[zakura-core/libraries](https://github.com/zakura-core/libraries). The library
target keeps the upstream name, so `use sapling_crypto::…` paths are unchanged.
Use it as a drop-in replacement by renaming the dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
sapling-crypto = { package = "zakura-sapling-crypto", version = "0.7" }
```

This crate contains an implementation of Zcash's "Sapling" cryptography.

## Sapling Pedersen hashing

The optional `fused-pedersen` feature caches fused chunk-block lookup tables
(~1.4 MiB at the default block size) to speed up non-circuit Pedersen hashing.
It is opt-in so that full-node applications can enable the higher-throughput
evaluator, while wallets and other memory-sensitive applications keep the
original 8-bit exp-window tables by default. Enable it on the dependency with
`features = ["fused-pedersen"]`.

Both evaluators return the same prime-order point; only the lookup tables and
online arithmetic differ.

## `no_std` compatibility

In order to take advantage of `no_std` builds, downstream users of this crate
must enable:

* the `spin_no_std` feature of the `lazy_static` crate; and

This is needed because the `--no-default-features` builds of these crates still
rely on `std`.
