# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to Rust's notion of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Forked from upstream `halo2_proofs` and renamed to `zakura-halo2-proofs`; this changelog starts
  fresh for the Zakura fork's initial release.
- Restarted the version lineage at 1.0.0, leaving behind the inherited upstream
  version (0.3.5); the initial Zakura release will be preceded by `1.0.0-rc` release
  candidates.
- Removed the unused `tempfile` dev-dependency inherited from upstream. Its
  `<3.7.0` cap held the workspace's `tempfile` at 3.6.0, whose `rustix 0.37`
  dependency no longer compiles on current Rust nightlies.
- The multi-opening prover and verifier now construct intermediate query sets
  in one pass.
- Multi-opening proof construction now returns an invalid-input error instead
  of panicking when given no queries, and verification rejects empty query sets.
- Polynomial evaluation now shares missing-root products across complete
  compressed-selector families.
- Polynomial evaluation now uses field squaring for structurally repeated
  multiplication operands.
- Polynomial evaluation now uses Horner's method for expanded fixed-base
  interpolation polynomials.
- Polynomial evaluation now shares repeated factors inside weighted constraint
  groups.
- Polynomial evaluation now caches repeated compiled subexpressions when doing
  so avoids at least three field multiplications.
- Polynomial evaluation now uses wide product accumulators when folding
  expressions over Pasta fields.
- Clarified internal vanishing-prover phase names to distinguish the random
  masking-polynomial commitment from quotient construction.
- **Breaking:** The public `ConstraintSystem::lookup` method now panics when its
  input-to-table map is empty; such calls previously constructed lookup
  arguments that constrained no circuit cells.
