# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to Rust's notion of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Added `MerkleHashBatchWorkspace` and
  `MerkleHashOrchard::combine_batch_with_workspace` under the
  `weighted-merkle` feature so repeated batched tree hashing can retain its
  temporary allocations.
- The `merkle` benchmark gained `4096-leaves-distinct` and
  `4096-leaves-distinct-batch`: a 2^12-leaf tree of seeded pseudorandom leaves
  drawn with repeats rejected, so every leaf is distinct by construction,
  generated once and cloned per sample outside the measurement. The
  `1024-leaves` cases are unchanged.
- `MerkleHashOrchard::combine_batch` is now pinned directly to fixed vectors:
  the protocol's empty roots at every level, the zcash-test-vectors Merkle
  path trees (every internal node checked, in per-tree and cross-tree batches),
  the zcashd-derived anchor through all 32 levels, and a deterministic
  2,048-leaf edge-case tree (special field values, single-bit and
  single-Sinsemilla-word patterns, empty roots) whose nodes are recorded in
  `test_vectors/merkle_fixture.rs`.
- The weighted Merkle word decoder's equivalence tests now include
  deterministic edge vectors (all-zero and all-one bit patterns, both ends of
  the canonical range, dense and alternating limbs) alongside the random
  property test, pinning the decoder's mask and shift boundaries.
- Prepared the `1.0.0-rc.2` release.
- Updated the curve stack to `ff 0.14`, `group 0.14`, and `rand 0.10`.
- Added `MerkleHashOrchard::combine_batch` for same-level Merkle node pairs,
  sharing projective-to-affine normalization across each batch.
- Weighted `MerkleHashOrchard::combine_batch` now delegates complete batch
  evaluation to `zakura-sinsemilla`, improving generator-table locality.
- Weighted Merkle hashing now decodes its fixed 52-word input directly from
  child field encodings instead of iterating through individual bits.
- The Sinsemilla Merkle CRH domain is now initialized once and reused for
  Orchard and Ironwood commitment-tree hashing instead of deriving the same
  generator for every node.
- Added `ProvingKey::verifying_key` to reuse the verifying key generated as
  part of proving-key construction.
- Added the opt-in `weighted-merkle` feature, which reuses a cached 52-word
  position-weighted Sinsemilla domain and omits incomplete-addition checks that
  are assumed infeasible under the discrete-logarithm relation (DLR)
  assumption. The default remains the lower-memory generic fused Sinsemilla
  evaluator with exact partial-function semantics.
- Batch trial-decryption key agreement now multiplies all of a batch's prepared
  ephemeral keys by each viewing key in one synchronized GLV call, picking up the
  batched-inversion affine ladder in `pasta_curves` for large scans. Trial
  decryption of undecryptable outputs (the wallet-scanning hot case) is about 9%
  faster end to end from the accompanying `pasta_curves` recoding change.
- Added reproducible one-Action prover and validated-corpus batch-verifier
  benchmark harnesses.
- The Sinsemilla note-commitment domain is now initialized once and reused
  instead of deriving the same generators for every commitment.
- Forked from upstream `orchard` and renamed to `zakura-orchard`; this changelog starts
  fresh for the Zakura fork's initial release.
- Restarted the version lineage at 1.0.0, leaving behind the inherited upstream
  version (0.15.5); the initial Zakura release will be preceded by `1.0.0-rc` release
  candidates.
