# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to Rust's notion of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Forked from upstream `pasta_curves` and renamed to `zakura-pasta-curves`; this changelog starts
  fresh for the Zakura fork's initial release.
- Restarted the version lineage at 1.0.0, leaving behind the inherited upstream
  version (0.5.2); the initial Zakura release will be preceded by `1.0.0-rc` release
  candidates.

### Added
- The `aarch64-asm` backend's exponentiation chains (`invert`, `pow_vartime`,
  and the square-root chains) use a fused "square `n` times, then multiply"
  assembly routine that keeps the accumulator in registers for the whole run.
- `x86_64-asm` feature flag, which enables runtime-selected BMI2 and ADX
  assembly for `Fp` and `Fq` multiplication and squaring on x86_64 targets,
  with a portable fallback on unsupported CPUs.

### Changed
- The `aarch64-asm` backend now implements runtime multiplication and
  squaring as inline assembly with register operands instead of calls into
  the assembly file. This removes the per-operation call and memory
  round-trip, which speeds up all composed arithmetic — notably curve point
  operations (`double`, mixed addition) and everything built on them.
- `Fp::pow_vartime` and `Fq::pow_vartime` now fuse each run of squarings with
  the following multiplication. The sequence of field operations (and thus
  the variable-time profile, which depends only on the exponent) is
  unchanged.
