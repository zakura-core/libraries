# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to Rust's notion of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- `Curve::batch_normalize` now runs its Montgomery batch inversion as two
  interleaved even/odd accumulator lanes for batches of 32 or more points
  (three extra multiplications per batch, one shared inversion), preserving the
  identity-skipping semantics; smaller batches keep the single chain. Measured
  about 21% less per element on Apple aarch64 with the assembly backend and 6%
  on x86-64 portable at large sizes; neutral on the Orchard Merkle workloads,
  where normalization is a small share of each combine.
- Prepared the `1.0.0-rc.2` release.
- Updated the curve traits to `ff 0.14`, `group 0.14`, and `rand_core 0.10`.
- `Fp`/`Fq` field inversion is now a variable-time 62-divstep safegcd (a
  Montgomery-native port of libsecp256k1's `modinv64`, exploiting both Pasta moduli's
  sparse `[m0, m1, 2, 0, 64]` radix-2^62 shape), replacing the Fermat exponentiation:
  measured 7.2x faster (4.83 µs → 0.67 µs, I/M ≈ 572 → ≈ 77 on Apple aarch64 with the
  assembly backend). **`Field::invert` is no longer constant-time in its input**: every
  inversion-bearing path (`to_affine`, `batch_normalize`, `ff` batch inversions, the
  GLV ladder, downstream Orchard/halo2 users) inherits variable-time inversion. This
  fork's inversion call sites operate on values whose timing is acceptable to leak;
  the previous data-oblivious behavior remains expressible via `pow_vartime(m - 2)`.
  The cheaper inversion, together with the ladder's batched inversions now skipping
  `ff::BatchInverter`'s per-element zero handling (the denominators are provably
  nonzero), re-tunes the GLV batch-affine threshold `BATCH_AFFINE_MIN_POINTS` from
  512 down to 32 live points (its measured break-even; ~5% per point better at 64
  and ~10% at 128 versus the per-point ladders).
- The GLV path now recodes the two halves of the scalar decomposition as a single
  width-3 NAF over the Eisenstein integers instead of two independent width-4 wNAFs,
  cutting the shared-doubling ladder from ~51 to ~39 mixed additions. `glv::Table`
  now stores the eight digit-orbit points with the x-coordinate in all three
  endomorphism rotations (1 KiB per table, previously 512 B). The public `glv` API
  and the native constant-time `Mul` are unchanged.
- Added `glv::Table::mul_decomposed_batch`, which multiplies many points by one
  scalar on affine accumulators, batching each ladder column's field inversions
  across the batch and fusing nonzero-digit columns as affine `2P+Q`. Batches under
  32 live points, and the scalar-dependent exceptional schedules (checked exactly
  per call), fall back to the per-point ladder.
  `CurveExt::batch_mul_same_scalar_vartime` now routes through it.
- Forked from upstream `pasta_curves` and renamed to `zakura-pasta-curves`; this changelog starts
  fresh for the Zakura fork's initial release.
- Restarted the version lineage at 1.0.0, leaving behind the inherited upstream
  version (0.5.2); the initial Zakura release will be preceded by `1.0.0-rc` release
  candidates.

### Added

- Added the hidden `pallas::add_mixed_pair_unchecked` helper for downstream
  batched arithmetic that can expose instruction-level parallelism across
  two incomplete mixed additions.
- The `aarch64-asm` backend's exponentiation chains (`invert`, `pow_vartime`,
  and the square-root chains) use a fused "square `n` times, then multiply"
  assembly routine that keeps the accumulator in registers for the whole run.

### Changed

- The `aarch64-asm` backend now implements runtime multiplication and
  squaring as inline assembly with register operands instead of calls into
  the assembly file. This removes the per-operation call and memory
  round-trip, which speeds up all composed arithmetic — notably curve point
  operations (`double`, mixed addition) and everything built on them.
- The `aarch64-asm` Montgomery multiplication no longer captures and compares
  a provably-zero fifth output limb. Direct `Fp` and `Fq` multiplication
  benchmarks are approximately 1.7% faster on Apple M4. The bound that makes
  the limb provably zero needs a canonical `rhs` (which every caller already
  supplies); the assembly wrappers now debug-assert it, since a violation
  would yield an incorrect residue rather than a merely non-canonical one.
- `Fp::pow_vartime` and `Fq::pow_vartime` now fuse each run of squarings with
  the following multiplication. The sequence of field operations (and thus
  the variable-time profile, which depends only on the exponent) is
  unchanged.
