//! GLV (Gallant–Lambert–Vanstone) scalar multiplication for the Pasta curves.
//!
//! Both Pasta curves carry a cube-root endomorphism
//! $\phi(x, y) = (\zeta x, y)$ (exposed as [`CurveExt::endo`]), for which
//! $\phi(P) = \lambda P$ with $\lambda$ = `Scalar::ZETA`. This module uses
//! that structure twice:
//!
//! - The scalar is split as $k = k_1 + k_2\lambda \pmod n$ with
//!   $|k_1|, |k_2| < 2^{127}$ (Babai rounding against a precomputed short
//!   lattice basis), and the pair is recoded as **one** width-3 NAF digit
//!   string over the Eisenstein integers $\mathbf{Z}[\omega]$
//!   ($\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, $\omega \mapsto \phi$). Digits are drawn
//!   from $\{0\} \cup U\Delta$, where $U = \{\pm1, \pm\omega, \pm\omega^2\}$
//!   are the units and $\Delta$ eight orbit representatives tiling the 48
//!   odd residue classes mod $8\mathbf{Z}[\omega]$; every nonzero digit is
//!   followed by at least two zeros. The ~127-column shared ladder then
//!   averages ~38–39 digit additions (at most 44), versus ~51 for two
//!   independent width-4 wNAFs over the halves.
//! - A digit $\pm\omega^e\delta$ acts on a stored point by an x-coordinate
//!   rotation (multiplication by $\zeta^e$, precomputed in the [`Table`])
//!   and a y negation, so one 8-orbit table serves all 48 nonzero digits.
//!
//! [`Table::mul_decomposed_batch`] additionally runs one scalar against many
//! points on *affine* accumulators: the digit schedule is shared by the
//! whole batch, so each ladder column batch-inverts its denominators with
//! Montgomery's trick, and every nonzero-digit column is evaluated as a
//! fused affine $2P + D$ (eliminating the intermediate y-coordinate and one
//! multiplication/squaring pair relative to double-then-add). Exceptional
//! column schedules — those that would hand an affine formula a zero
//! denominator — depend only on the scalar, are checked exactly per batch,
//! and fall back to the per-point ladder.
//!
//! This path is variable-time in the scalar (GLV decomposition plus digit
//! recoding); the `_glv` naming distinguishes it from the native `Mul`
//! implementations, which are unchanged.

//! # Amortization
//!
//! The costs split into three independently reusable pieces:
//!
//! - [`Table`]: per *point*. [`Table::batch`] builds many tables with one
//!   shared batch normalization (a single field inversion for the whole
//!   batch).
//! - [`Decomposed`]: per *scalar*. Decomposition and joint digit recoding
//!   are hoisted so one scalar can be multiplied against many tables.
//! - [`Table::mul_decomposed`] / [`Table::mul_decomposed_batch`]: the
//!   remaining per-(point, scalar) work — a shared-doubling ladder over the
//!   joint digit string, batched across points where the batch is large
//!   enough to amortize its per-column inversions.
//!
//! One-shot use is [`GlvParams::mul_glv`].
